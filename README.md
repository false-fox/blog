# Welcome to my website!
My personal website, blog & posts :)

# Anecdotes & Thoughts
## Design
I wanted to design a website for myself, i've had several in the past but always been disastisfied with how they turned out, trying different design styles never ended up well and always turned out tacky. 

I realized minimalism is the best way to go and wanted to create a design that's fast, readable and usable above all else. I ended up with my simple mimimalist design. 

I was inspired by the motherfuckingwebsite series of websites, definitely. I used the <a\> element colors and backdrop from [perfectmotherfuckingwebsite](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/), it's truly perfection. Put the websites side by side and you'll see a resemblance.

## Typography
You know what I hate? unreadable textwalls. Text is very important, especially for a blog, so I focused hard on that element.

 I used [MPLUS](https://mplusfonts.github.io/) for it's incredible readability in most situations and it's support for latin, kanji and kana. 

The default font size is 1.1em, the default line-height 1.5 and the max-width is ~75 characters long.

The entire website's content is centered and set to a max width of ~75 characters to ensure it'll be readable and consistent on any screen.

## Astro
I think astro is great. To me, it's a sort of upgraded HTML. Components, inline css and markdown support is something I can't live without anymore.

## Email troubles
You might notice that there's nowhere on my website that I have my full, uninterupted email. I always break it up like "My email is me@ then the domain of my website." this is on purpose for two reasons:

a) Bots will scrape pages on the internet and use regex to find emails, then sell it to advertisers, spammers and scammers. Having interrupted email strings prevents these bots from capturing my email.

b) It adds enough mental gymnastics that spammers will get bored but people that actually want to talk to me can still figure it out.

## License
Choosing a license for my blog is impossible. On one hand, I want to uphold my leftist open-source copyleft principles, but I think an open-source blog has a LOT more implications than open-source software. 

If I license this repository under an open source license, will I opening myself to having posts be entirely plagerized by content farms? Does that mean any company can yoink my photos, videos, audio recordings, life stories, writings etc for their commercial enterprises and I can't do anything about it? It leaves a lot of questions to be asked.

I know i'm overthinking this and overestimating my importance and influence, but personally, I'm keeping the blog as "copyrighted, all rights reserved" for safety and marking it as "source available". BUT, If you're a fellow well-intentioned developer and want to take code snippets, be inspired by my designs and work or cite my blog posts as a source you're more than welcome to :) 

## 404 page
Tired of these wacky 404 pages, I think I did a really nice job with my 404 page and i'm proud of it.
